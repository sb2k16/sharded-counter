# Chapter 8: Fault Tolerance and High Availability

## Failure Scenarios

- **Node Failures**: Hardware, software, or network issues can cause nodes to go offline.
- **Network Partitions**: Split-brain scenarios where nodes cannot communicate.
- **Data Corruption**: Hardware or software bugs can corrupt data.

## Graceful Degradation

- **Partial Failure Handling**: Continue serving requests with available shards.
- **Read-Only Mode**: Switch to read-only if writes cannot be safely processed.

## Automatic Recovery

- **Node Recovery**: Restart and resynchronize failed nodes.
- **Data Recovery**: Restore from healthy replicas or backups.

## Health Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: Regularly verify node, storage, and network health.
- **Alerting**: Notify operators of failures or degraded performance.

## Backup and Restore

- **Scheduled Backups**: Periodically back up persistent storage.
- **Restore Procedures**: Restore data to new or recovered nodes.

## Disaster Recovery

- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Procedures for catastrophic failures (e.g., data center outage).
- **Automatic Failover**: Promote replicas to primary if needed.
