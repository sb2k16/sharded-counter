# Chapter 10: Real-World Use Cases and Best Practices

## Use Cases

- **Social Media Applications**: Likes, shares, and view counters at massive scale.
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Product views, purchases, and inventory counters.
- **IoT and Sensor Data**: Aggregating high-frequency sensor events.
- **Gaming and Leaderboards**: Real-time score and ranking updates.
- **Analytics and Metrics**: High-throughput event and metric aggregation.

## Implementation Best Practices

- **Choose Consistency Level**: Match consistency to business needs (eventual, strong, quorum).
- **Monitor Hotspots**: Watch for uneven load and rebalance shards as needed.
- **Test Failure Scenarios**: Regularly simulate node and network failures.
- **Automate Backups**: Schedule and verify backups.
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypt inter-node traffic and restrict access.

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Single Shard Bottlenecks**: Avoid routing all traffic to one shard.
- **Ignoring Replication Lag**: Monitor and address lag between primaries and replicas.
- **Neglecting Recovery Procedures**: Regularly test disaster recovery and restore processes.
