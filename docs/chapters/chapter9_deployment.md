# Chapter 9: Deployment and Operations

## Deployment Architecture

- **Multi-Node Deployment**: Run coordinators and shards on separate servers or containers.
- **Configuration Management**: Use configuration files or orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes).

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Metrics**: Expose metrics for counters, latency, throughput, and errors.
- **Logging**: Centralized logging for debugging and auditing.
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows.

## Maintenance Procedures

- **Rolling Updates**: Update nodes without downtime.
- **Scaling Operations**: Add or remove shards and coordinators as needed.
- **Backup and Restore**: Regularly back up data and test restores.

## Security Considerations

- **Network Security**: Secure inter-node communication (TLS, firewalls).
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to APIs and storage.
- **Audit Logging**: Track access and changes for compliance.
